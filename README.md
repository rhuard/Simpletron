Simpletron
==========

Simpletron simulator in C. A simpletron is a program that simulates a simple computer. Where the user can enter in a simple program in the Simpletron Machine Language (SML). (the SML will be descirbed at a latter date)

I am making this project to help keep me in practice with using C.

The idea for this program is from the seventh edition of C how to Program from Deitel.
